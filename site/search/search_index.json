The tutorial uses code from Ripser by Ulrich Bauer (Bauer, 2015) and a variety of other places, referenced throughout the text. The first section of this tutorial (Persistent homology) requires no software download. However, you do need to download some datasets, which you can get from this folder in the book's GitHub repository . Persistent homology \u00b6 You can get the PDF slides for Henry's introduction to persistent homology here . We will be using Ripser in this tutorial. Some slides about how Ripser works are available here . Ripser in your browser - synthetic examples \u00b6 The easiest way to run Ripser is in a live demo in your browser, for which no installation (and in particular, no Python) is required. Try it out! . House example - distance matrix \u00b6 For example, we can use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips complex of the following 5 points in the plane. The distance matrix for these five points can be downloaded here . It contains the 5x5 distance matrix corresponding to the collection of 5 points in the plane shown above. The contents of the file are as follows. 0, 2.0000, 2.8284, 2.0000, 3.1623 2.0000, 0, 2.0000, 2.8284, 3.1623 2.8284, 2.0000, 0, 2.0000, 1.4142 2.0000, 2.8482, 2.0000, 0, 1.4142 3.1623, 3.1623, 1.4142, 1.4142, 0 At the Ripser live webpage, enter the following input (including choosing to upload that distance matrix file, as shown). Ripser should give the following output in your browser. Note that the 5 connected components merge into one, with merging events happening at scales \\sqrt 2 \\sqrt 2 and 2. There is a single 1-dimensional feature, beginning at scale parameter 2 and ending at scale parameter \\sqrt 8 \\sqrt 8 . House example - point cloud \u00b6 Instead of loading a distance matrix, it is also possible to to load in a set of points in Euclidean space, listed by their Euclidean coordinates. See, for example, this file . It is the 5\\times2 5\\times2 matrix corresponding to the same collection of 5 points in the plane. To input a point cloud in Ripser live, simply select the option \"point cloud\" instead of \"distance matrix.\" You will get the same output as above! Torus example \u00b6 The following example computes the persistent homology barcodes of a 20\\times20 20\\times20 grid of 400 points on the unit torus S^1\\times S^1 S^1\\times S^1 in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\mathbb{R}^4 , where a small amount of noise has been added to each point. You can download the point cloud data file here . Only a subset of the intervals are shown below. Note that the long barcodes (roughly between scale parameter 0.7 and 1.5) recover the homology of the torus, with a single connected component, with two 1-dimensional holes, and with a single 2-dimensional hole. Sphere example, with a Python script to create the points \u00b6 A set of points sampled uniformly at random from the unit sphere can be downloaded here . But you don't have to use that particular set of randomly generated points. You can generate your own, as follows. Download and run the Python script sphere_points.py . It will sample 500 points from the unit sphere S^2 S^2 in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 , and then save the point cloud to a text file named sphere_points.txt . (If you have downloaded the entire code repository, you may want to move that file into the point_clouds folder.) We can compute the persistent homology barcodes in Ripser. So that the computation finishes, we have asked Ripser to compute only up to scale parameter 1.2. (One can compute larger examples after downloading Ripser to one's machine, as in a later section.) Only a subset of the intervals are shown below. Note that the long barcodes (roughly between scale parameter 0.55 and 1.2) recover the homology of the 2-sphere, with a single connected component, no 1-dimensional holes, and a single 2-dimensional hole. Ripser in your browser - cyclooctane data \u00b6 This is an example with a real dataset of cyclooctane molecule conformations. The cyclooctane molecule consists of a ring of 8 carbon atoms (shown in black), each bonded to a pair of hydrogen atoms (shown in white). The cyclooctane molecule C 8 H 16 consists of a ring of 8 carbons atoms, each bonded to a pair of hydrogen atoms. A conformation of this molecule is a chemically and physically possible realization in 3D space, modulo translations and rotations. The locations of the carbon atoms in a conformation determine the locations of the hydrogen atoms via energy minimization, and hence each molecule conformation can be mapped to a point in \\mathbb{R}^{24}=\\mathbb{R}^{8\\times3} \\mathbb{R}^{24}=\\mathbb{R}^{8\\times3} , as there are eight carbon atoms in the molecule and each carbon location is represented by three coordinates x,y,z x,y,z . This map realizes the conformation space of cyclooctane as a subset of \\mathbb{R}^{24} \\mathbb{R}^{24} . It turns out that the conformation space is a two-dimensional stratefied space, i.e., a two-dimensional manifold with singularities. Furthermore, Brown et al. (2008), Martin et al. (2010), and Martin and Watson (2011) show that the conformation space of cyclooctane is the union of a sphere with a Klein bottle, glued together along two circles of singularities. (See Chapter 10 of Data Science for Mathematicians for more detail, or Figures 7 and 8 in Martin and Watson (2011).) Indeed, the algorithm they develop allows them to triangulate this conformation space from a finite sample. Zomorodian (2012) uses the cyclooctane dataset as an example to show that we can efficiently recover the homology groups of the conformation space using persistent homology. In this section we essentially follow Zomorodian's example. We begin with a sample of 1,000 points on the conformation space. (This data is publicly available at Shawn Martin's webpage .) We then compute the resulting persistent homology. We obtain the Betti numbers b_0=b_1=1 b_0=b_1=1 and b_2=2 b_2=2 , which match the homology groups of the union of a sphere with a Klein bottle, glued together along two circles of singularities. The following example computes the persistent homology barcodes of 1,000 points from the configuration space of cyclooctane molecules in \\mathbb{R}^{24} \\mathbb{R}^{24} . This dataset is available here . So that the computation finishes, we have asked Ripser to compute only up to scale parameter 1.3. (One can compute larger examples after downloading Ripser to one's machine, as in a later section.) Only a subset of the intervals are shown below. The long barcodes (roughly between scale parameter 0.65 and 1.25), with one connected component, one 1-dimensional hole, and two 2-dimensional holes, match the homology of the union of a sphere with a Klein bottle, glued together along two circles of singularities. Ripser in your browser - optical image patch data \u00b6 This is an example with a real dataset of optical image patch data. The optical image database collected by van Hateren and van der Schaaf (1998) contains black and white digital photographs from a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes. Lee et al. (2003) study 3\\times3 3\\times3 patches from these images, and Carlsson et al. (2008) continue the analysis of image patches using persistent homology. Carlsson et al. (2008) begin with a large collection of high-contrast, normalized 3\\times3 3\\times3 pixel patches, each thought of as a point in \\mathbb{R}^9 \\mathbb{R}^9 . They change to the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis, which maps the patches to the unit sphere S^7 S^7 in \\mathbb{R}^8 \\mathbb{R}^8 . They select from this space the 30% densest vectors, where density is based on the distance from a point to its 300 th nearest neighbor. In Carlsson et al. (2008), this dense core subset is denoted X(300,30) X(300,30) . In the next example we verify the result from Carlsson et al. (2008): X(300,30) X(300,30) has the topology of a circle. The following example computes the persistent homology barcodes of 1,000 points from X(300,30) X(300,30) . The dataset can be downloaded here . So that the computation finishes, we have asked Ripser to compute only up to scale parameter 1.3. (One can compute larger examples after downloading Ripser to one's machine, as in a later section.) Only a subset of the intervals are shown below. The long barcodes (roughly between scale parameter 0.5 and 1.25), with one connected component and one 1-dimensional hole, have the homology of a circle. This is good evidence that the core subset X(300,30) X(300,30) is well-approximated by a circle. We plot the projection of these points onto the first two linear gradient Discrete Cosine Transform basis vectors. The projection of X(300,30) X(300,30) above shows a circle. It is called the optical primary circle and is parameterized as shown below. We can also consider the 3-circle model, which arises from the dataset X(15,30) X(15,30) that corresponds to a more local estimate of density. The dataset can be downloaded here . So that the computation finishes, we select only 1,000 points from X(15,30) X(15,30) , and we have asked Ripser to compute only up to scale parameter 1.2. (One can compute larger examples after downloading Ripser to one's machine, as in a later section.) Only a subset of the intervals are shown below. The barcodes with one connected component and five 1-dimensional holes correspond to the 3-circle model for the core subset X(15,30) X(15,30) . Much more convincing (longer) intervals can be obtained by using more points and computing with Ripser downloaded to your local machine. We plot the projection of these points onto the first two linear gradient Discrete Cosine Transform basis vectors. The corresponding three-circle model for optical images is shown below. Exercises on persistent homology \u00b6 Exercise : Write a script (say in Python, or some other language) that selects 400 points uniformly at random (or approximately uniformly at random) from the annulus $$ \\left\\{ (x,y)\\mid 0.95^2\\leq x^2+y^2\\leq1.05^2 \\right\\} $$ in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mathbb{R}^2 . Compute its persistent homology barcodes using Ripser. Exercise : Write a script (say in Python, or some other language) that selects 400 points uniformly at random (or approximately uniformly at random) from the \"coconut shell\" $$ \\left\\{ (x,y,z) \\mid 0.95^2\\leq x^2+y^2+z^2\\leq 1.05^2 \\right\\} $$ in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 . Compute its persistent homology barcodes using Ripser. Exercise : Write a Python script (or code in some other language) that will select n n evenly-spaced points from the unit circle in the plane. Compute the persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips complex of 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 20 equally spaced points on the circle. Do you get ever homology above dimension 1? Exercise : Find a planar dataset Z Z in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mathbb{R}^2 and a filtration value t t such that VR(Z,t) VR(Z,t) has nonzero Betti number b_2 b_2 . Do a computation in Ripser to confirm your answer. Exercise : Find a planar dataset Z Z in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mathbb{R}^2 and a filtration value t t such that VR(Z,t) VR(Z,t) has nonzero Betti number b_6 b_6 . Do a computation in Ripser to confirm your answer. Exercise : Let X X be the 8 vertices of the cube in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 , X=\\{(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,\\pm 1)\\} X=\\{(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,\\pm 1)\\} . Equip X X with the Euclidean metric. Compute the persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips complex of X X . Do you get ever homology above dimension 2? Exercise : One way to produce a torus is to take a square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then identify opposite sides. This is called a flat torus. More explicitly, the flat torus is the quotient space ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim , where (0, y) \\sim (1, y) (0, y) \\sim (1, y) for all y y in [0, 1] [0, 1] and where (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) for all x x in [0, 1] [0, 1] . The Euclidean metric on [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] induces a metric on the flat torus. For example, in the induced metric on the flat torus, the distance between (0, 1/2) (0, 1/2) and (1, 1/2) (1, 1/2) is zero, since these two points are identified. The distance between (1/10, 1/2) (1/10, 1/2) and (9/10, 1/2) (9/10, 1/2) is 2/10 2/10 , by passing through the point (0, 1/2) \\sim (1, 1/2) (0, 1/2) \\sim (1, 1/2) . Write a Python script (or code in another language) that selects 400 random points from the square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then computes the 400\\times400 400\\times400 distance matrix for these points under the induced metric on the flat torus. Use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of this metric space. Exercise : One way to produce a Klein bottle is to take a square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then identify opposite edges, with the left and right sides identified with a twist. This is called a flat Klein bottle. More explicitly, the flat Klein bottle is the quotient space ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim , where (0, y) \\sim (1, 1 - y) (0, y) \\sim (1, 1 - y) for all y y in [0, 1] [0, 1] and where (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) for all x x in [0, 1] [0, 1] . The Euclidean metric on [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] induces a metric on the flat Klein bottle. For example, in the induced metric on the flat Klein bottle, the distance between (0, 4/10) (0, 4/10) and (1, 6/10) (1, 6/10) is zero, since these two points are identified. The distance between (1/10, 4/10) (1/10, 4/10) and (9/10, 6/10) (9/10, 6/10) is 2/10 2/10 , by passing through the point (0, 4/10) \\sim (1, 6/10) (0, 4/10) \\sim (1, 6/10) . Write a Python script (or code in another language) that selects 400 random points from the square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then computes the 400\\times400 400\\times400 distance matrix for these points under the induced metric on the flat Klein bottle. Use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of this metric space. If you have Ripser installed on your local machine, change to \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} coefficients and see how the persistent homology changes. Exercise : One way to produce a projective plane is to take the unit sphere S^2 S^2 in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 and then identify antipodal points. More explicitly, the projective plane is the quotient space S^2 / (x \\sim -x) S^2 / (x \\sim -x) . The Euclidean metric on S^2 S^2 induces a metric on the projective plane. Write a Python script (or code in another language) that selects 400 random points from the unit sphere S^2 S^2 in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 and then computes the 400\\times400 400\\times400 distance matrix for these points under the induced metric on the projective plane. Use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of this metric space. If you have Ripser installed on your local machine, change to \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} coefficients and see how the persistent homology changes. Ripser on your machine \u00b6 A more advanced (but very useful) step is to now download Ripser to your machine and to run it locally. This allows you to perform larger computations. Ripser is written in C++. You may download the code for Ripser here , which also contains installation instructions. Minimal installation instructions are listed below git clone https://github.com/Ripser/ripser.git cd ripser make all ./ripser examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix For convenience, you may want to download all the content of this folder and copy the executable file ripser into that folder, then cd into the same folder. You can use the flag --format distances to specify you are computing on a distance matrix, or --format point-cloud to specify you are computing on a point cloud. The flag --dim k specifies that homology is computed only up to dimension k k , and the flag --threshold t specifies that persistent homology is computed only up to scale parameter t t . For example, we can recreate all of the examples above with the following commands. House example on the distance matrix: ./ripser --format distance distance_matrices/house_distances.txt House example on the point cloud: ./ripser --format point-cloud point_clouds/house_points.txt Torus example, up to 2-dimensional homology: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 2 point_clouds/torus_points.txt Sphere example, up to scale parameter 1.2: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 2 --threshold 1 .2 point_clouds/sphere_points.txt Cyclooctane example. Try increasing the distance threshold gradually and see if your computer can do better than Ripser in your browser: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 2 --threshold 1 .3 point_clouds/cyclooctane_points.txt Optical image patch example: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 1 --threshold 1 .3 point_clouds/optical_k300_points.txt Instead of just printing Ripser's output to the terminal, you can also save it to a text file. The below example also saves the output to the text file house_points_ripser_printed.txt . ./ripser --format point-cloud point_clouds/house_points.txt | tee -a house_points_ripser_printed.txt Python \u00b6 The remainder of this tutorial requires one to have Python and/or the Ripser software package installed. Installing and running new code can be frustrating, especially if it is in a language (perhaps Python) that is unfamiliar to you. Nevertheless, we believe that it is extremely important for all practitioners of machine learning to have some exposure to Python. For this reason, the time you spend getting Python running on your machine is time well spent, even though this can feel like a frustrating investment of time. If you don't yet have Python, and if you are a PC user, then we recommend installing Anaconda . If you don't yet have Python, and if you are a Mac user, then we recommend installing Python 2.7.15 from here . We expect the code to work with an existing version of Python that you may happen to have already. Ripser with Python \u00b6 Melissa McGuirl has written very nice code for using Ripser with Python, which is what we will use in this section. In particular, the file house_points_ripser_printed.txt that we saved in the section above is not in a format that is terribly easy to work with. Melissa's code reformats Ripser output in a convenient manner. Alternatively, there is a Cython wrapper for Ripser available which might be more efficient and better for non-Linux machines. The wrapper is available here or here . Ensure you are in the folder of data files mentioned above and copy the Ripser executable into that folder as suggested earlier. (Or, alternatively, make sure that Ripser is in your Python path, and then in line 45 of getBarCodes.py , change ./ripser to ripser ). In your terminal, try running the following command. python getBarCodes.py -i distance_matrices/ -o ripser_outputs/ This will take every distance matrix in the folder distance_matrices , compute the persistent homology barcodes for the Vietoris-Rips complex built on top of this metric space, and print the output barcodes to the folder ripser_outputs . The following command then separates the Ripser output into barcode intervals separated by dimension. python separateRipser.py -i ripser_outputs/ -o barcodes/ And the following command then plots the corresponding persistence diagrams in your current directory. python plotpd.py -i barcodes/ -o ./ Melissa's code is written to work only with input metric space data in the form of a distance matrix, but one could edit it to also work with input metric space data in the form of a point cloud, for example. Topological feature vectors - persistent homology and machine learning \u00b6 There are by now a wide variety of ways to incorporate persistent homology information into feature vectors for a machine learning task (Adcock et al 2016, Adams et al 2017, Atienza 2018, Bendich et al 2016, Bubenik 2015, Bubenik & Dlotko 2016, Carriere et al 2015, Carriere & Bauer 2018, Carriere et al 2018, Chazal & Divol 2018, Chen et al 2015, Chevyrev et al 2018, Chung et al 2009, Di Fabio & Ferri 2015, Hofer et al 2017, Kalisnik 2018, Reininghaus et al 2015, Skraba 2018, Topaz et al 2015, Zeppelzauer et al 2016). We tersely describe a few of these approaches. For Henry's \"from persistent homology to machine learning\" survey slides from the ICERM TRIPODS bootcamp, please see here . Persistence landscpaes \u00b6 One example is persistence landscapes (Bubenik 2015). Bubenik & Dlotko (2017) have made their code available , and persistence landscapes are also implementable in R-TDA . Persistence images \u00b6 A second example is persistence images (Adams et al 2017), with Python code available from Nathaniel Saul (Persims) or Francis Motta , and with Matlab code available here . We'll attempt to describe how to compute persistence images using the Jupyter notebooks accompanying Nathaniel Saul's Persim code . First, download the Persim code. Second, install Jupyter , perhaps using Anaconda as described in that link. Open a new terminal (which is often required after new installations) and in that terminal, try the following command. jupyter notebook This should open a window in an internet browser. In this browser window, change directories to persim/notebooks , and then open the Jupyter notebook Persistence Images.ipynb . You should then be able to run the code in the browser! Topological feature vectors - coding challenges \u00b6 6 shape classes \u00b6 Change directory to the folder topological-data-analysis/topological-feature-vectors/data-6-shape-classes . NOTE: Folder missing--must fix! This subfolder contains persistence diagram data for 6 shape classes: A unit cube A circle of diameter one A sphere of diameter one Three clusters with centers randomly chosen in the unit cube Three clusters within three clusters A torus with a major diameter of one and a minor diameter of one half. These shape classes are described in Section 6.1 of the paper Persistence Images: A Stable Vector Representation of Persistent Homology , and are shown below. We produced 25 point clouds of 500 randomly sampled points from each shape class. We then added a level of Gaussian noise to each point, at a noise level neta=0.1 or neta=0.05. We then have already computed the persistent homology intervals in homological dimension i=0 and i=1. Should \"neta\" here be \"eta\" (Greek letter)? If so, we can then use MathJax on these equations. For example, the file ToyData_PD_n05_23_6_0.txt corresponds to noise level neta=0.05, the 23 rd point cloud randomly sampled from shape class 6., with persistent homology computed in dimension 0. Each row of this file has two entries: the birth and death time of a 0-dimensional persistent homology interval. By contrast, the file ToyData_PD_n1_21_3_1.txt corresponds to noise level neta=1, the 21 st point cloud randomly sampled from shape class 3., with persistent homology computed in dimension 1. Each row of this file has two entries: the birth and death time of a 1-dimensional persistent homology interval. Your task is to use machine learning to distinguish these six classes from each other. In a K-medoids clustering test, some accuracies and computation times are displayed for bottleneck distances, Wasserstein distances, persistence landscapes, and persistence images in Table 1 of Persistence Images: A Stable Vector Representation of Persistent Homology . Do you have ideas for beating these accuracies or computation times? In the above table, PD means the persistence diagram equipped with either the L^1 L^1 (1-Wasserstein), L^2 L^2 (2-Wasserstein), or sup (bottleneck) metrics. PL means the persistence landscape, equipped with either the L^1 L^1 , L^2 L^2 , or sup metric. PI means the persistence image, equipped with either the L^1 L^1 , L^2 L^2 , or sup metric. But you should develop your own techniques for turning barcodes into feature vectors, and see how they compare! Some Matlab code for creating points from these shape classes is available here .

The cyclooctane molecule consists of a ring of 8 carbon atoms (shown in black), each bonded to a pair of hydrogen atoms (shown in white). The cyclooctane molecule C 8 H 16 consists of a ring of 8 carbons atoms, each bonded to a pair of hydrogen atoms. A conformation of this molecule is a chemically and physically possible realization in 3D space, modulo translations and rotations. The locations of the carbon atoms in a conformation determine the locations of the hydrogen atoms via energy minimization, and hence each molecule conformation can be mapped to a point in \\mathbb{R}^{24}=\\mathbb{R}^{8\\times3} \\mathbb{R}^{24}=\\mathbb{R}^{8\\times3} , as there are eight carbon atoms in the molecule and each carbon location is represented by three coordinates x,y,z x,y,z . This map realizes the conformation space of cyclooctane as a subset of \\mathbb{R}^{24} \\mathbb{R}^{24} . It turns out that the conformation space is a two-dimensional stratefied space, i.e., a two-dimensional manifold with singularities. Furthermore, Brown et al. (2008), Martin et al. (2010), and Martin and Watson (2011) show that the conformation space of cyclooctane is the union of a sphere with a Klein bottle, glued together along two circles of singularities. (See Chapter 10 of Data Science for Mathematicians for more detail, or Figures 7 and 8 in Martin and Watson (2011).) Indeed, the algorithm they develop allows them to triangulate this conformation space from a finite sample. Zomorodian (2012) uses the cyclooctane dataset as an example to show that we can efficiently recover the homology groups of the conformation space using persistent homology. In this section we essentially follow Zomorodian's example. We begin with a sample of 1,000 points on the conformation space. (This data is publicly available at Shawn Martin's webpage .) We then compute the resulting persistent homology. We obtain the Betti numbers b_0=b_1=1 b_0=b_1=1 and b_2=2 b_2=2 , which match the homology groups of the union of a sphere with a Klein bottle, glued together along two circles of singularities. The following example computes the persistent homology barcodes of 1,000 points from the configuration space of cyclooctane molecules in \\mathbb{R}^{24} \\mathbb{R}^{24} .

The optical image database collected by van Hateren and van der Schaaf (1998) contains black and white digital photographs from a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes. Lee et al. (2003) study 3\\times3 3\\times3 patches from these images, and Carlsson et al. (2008) continue the analysis of image patches using persistent homology. Carlsson et al. (2008) begin with a large collection of high-contrast, normalized 3\\times3 3\\times3 pixel patches, each thought of as a point in \\mathbb{R}^9 \\mathbb{R}^9 . They change to the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis, which maps the patches to the unit sphere S^7 S^7 in \\mathbb{R}^8 \\mathbb{R}^8 . They select from this space the 30% densest vectors, where density is based on the distance from a point to its 300 th nearest neighbor. In Carlsson et al. (2008), this dense core subset is denoted X(300,30) X(300,30) . In the next example we verify the result from Carlsson et al. (2008): X(300,30) X(300,30) has the topology of a circle. The following example computes the persistent homology barcodes of 1,000 points from X(300,30) X(300,30) . The dataset can be downloaded here .

We plot the projection of these points onto the first two linear gradient Discrete Cosine Transform basis vectors. The projection of X(300,30) X(300,30) above shows a circle. It is called the optical primary circle and is parameterized as shown below. We can also consider the 3-circle model, which arises from the dataset X(15,30) X(15,30) that corresponds to a more local estimate of density. The dataset can be downloaded here .

Exercise : One way to produce a torus is to take a square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then identify opposite sides. This is called a flat torus. More explicitly, the flat torus is the quotient space ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim , where (0, y) \\sim (1, y) (0, y) \\sim (1, y) for all y y in [0, 1] [0, 1] and where (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) for all x x in [0, 1] [0, 1] . The Euclidean metric on [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] induces a metric on the flat torus. For example, in the induced metric on the flat torus, the distance between (0, 1/2) (0, 1/2) and (1, 1/2) (1, 1/2) is zero, since these two points are identified. The distance between (1/10, 1/2) (1/10, 1/2) and (9/10, 1/2) (9/10, 1/2) is 2/10 2/10 , by passing through the point (0, 1/2) \\sim (1, 1/2) (0, 1/2) \\sim (1, 1/2) . Write a Python script (or code in another language) that selects 400 random points from the square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then computes the 400\\times400 400\\times400 distance matrix for these points under the induced metric on the flat torus. Use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of this metric space. Exercise : One way to produce a Klein bottle is to take a square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then identify opposite edges, with the left and right sides identified with a twist. This is called a flat Klein bottle. More explicitly, the flat Klein bottle is the quotient space ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim ([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]) / \\sim , where (0, y) \\sim (1, 1 - y) (0, y) \\sim (1, 1 - y) for all y y in [0, 1] [0, 1] and where (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) (x, 0) \\sim (x, 1) for all x x in [0, 1] [0, 1] . The Euclidean metric on [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] induces a metric on the flat Klein bottle. For example, in the induced metric on the flat Klein bottle, the distance between (0, 4/10) (0, 4/10) and (1, 6/10) (1, 6/10) is zero, since these two points are identified. The distance between (1/10, 4/10) (1/10, 4/10) and (9/10, 6/10) (9/10, 6/10) is 2/10 2/10 , by passing through the point (0, 4/10) \\sim (1, 6/10) (0, 4/10) \\sim (1, 6/10) . Write a Python script (or code in another language) that selects 400 random points from the square [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] and then computes the 400\\times400 400\\times400 distance matrix for these points under the induced metric on the flat Klein bottle. Use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of this metric space. If you have Ripser installed on your local machine, change to \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} coefficients and see how the persistent homology changes. Exercise : One way to produce a projective plane is to take the unit sphere S^2 S^2 in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 and then identify antipodal points. More explicitly, the projective plane is the quotient space S^2 / (x \\sim -x) S^2 / (x \\sim -x) . The Euclidean metric on S^2 S^2 induces a metric on the projective plane. Write a Python script (or code in another language) that selects 400 random points from the unit sphere S^2 S^2 in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mathbb{R}^3 and then computes the 400\\times400 400\\times400 distance matrix for these points under the induced metric on the projective plane. Use Ripser to compute the persistent homology of this metric space.

This allows you to perform larger computations. Ripser is written in C++. You may download the code for Ripser here , which also contains installation instructions. Minimal installation instructions are listed below git clone https://github.com/Ripser/ripser.git cd ripser make all ./ripser examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix For convenience, you may want to download all the content of this folder and copy the executable file ripser into that folder, then cd into the same folder. You can use the flag --format distances to specify you are computing on a distance matrix, or --format point-cloud to specify you are computing on a point cloud. The flag --dim k specifies that homology is computed only up to dimension k k , and the flag --threshold t specifies that persistent homology is computed only up to scale parameter t t . For example, we can recreate all of the examples above with the following commands. House example on the distance matrix: ./ripser --format distance distance_matrices/house_distances.txt House example on the point cloud: ./ripser --format point-cloud point_clouds/house_points.txt Torus example, up to 2-dimensional homology: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 2 point_clouds/torus_points.txt Sphere example, up to scale parameter 1.2: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 2 --threshold 1 .2 point_clouds/sphere_points.txt Cyclooctane example. Try increasing the distance threshold gradually and see if your computer can do better than Ripser in your browser: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 2 --threshold 1 .3 point_clouds/cyclooctane_points.txt Optical image patch example: ./ripser --format point-cloud --dim 1 --threshold 1 .3 point_clouds/optical_k300_points.txt Instead of just printing Ripser's output to the terminal, you can also save it to a text file.

Installing and running new code can be frustrating, especially if it is in a language (perhaps Python) that is unfamiliar to you. Nevertheless, we believe that it is extremely important for all practitioners of machine learning to have some exposure to Python. For this reason, the time you spend getting Python running on your machine is time well spent, even though this can feel like a frustrating investment of time. If you don't yet have Python, and if you are a PC user, then we recommend installing Anaconda . If you don't yet have Python, and if you are a Mac user, then we recommend installing Python 2.7.15 from here . We expect the code to work with an existing version of Python that you may happen to have already.","title":"Python"},{"location":"persistent-homology-tutorial/#ripser-with-python","text":"Melissa McGuirl has written very nice code for using Ripser with Python, which is what we will use in this section. In particular, the file house_points_ripser_printed.txt that we saved in the section above is not in a format that is terribly easy to work with. Melissa's code reformats Ripser output in a convenient manner. Alternatively, there is a Cython wrapper for Ripser available which might be more efficient and better for non-Linux machines. The wrapper is available here or here . Ensure you are in the folder of data files mentioned above and copy the Ripser executable into that folder as suggested earlier. (Or, alternatively, make sure that Ripser is in your Python path, and then in line 45 of getBarCodes.py , change ./ripser to ripser ). In your terminal, try running the following command. python getBarCodes.py -i distance_matrices/ -o ripser_outputs/ This will take every distance matrix in the folder distance_matrices , compute the persistent homology barcodes for the Vietoris-Rips complex built on top of this metric space, and print the output barcodes to the folder ripser_outputs . The following command then separates the Ripser output into barcode intervals separated by dimension. python separateRipser.py -i ripser_outputs/ -o barcodes/ And the following command then plots the corresponding persistence diagrams in your current directory. python plotpd.py -i barcodes/ -o ./ Melissa's code is written to work only with input metric space data in the form of a distance matrix, but one could edit it to also work with input metric space data in the form of a point cloud, for example.","title":"Ripser with Python"},{"location":"persistent-homology-tutorial/#topological-feature-vectors-persistent-homology-and-machine-learning","text":"There are by now a wide variety of ways to incorporate persistent homology information into feature vectors for a machine learning task (Adcock et al 2016, Adams et al 2017, Atienza 2018, Bendich et al 2016, Bubenik 2015, Bubenik & Dlotko 2016, Carriere et al 2015, Carriere & Bauer 2018, Carriere et al 2018, Chazal & Divol 2018, Chen et al 2015, Chevyrev et al 2018, Chung et al 2009, Di Fabio & Ferri 2015, Hofer et al 2017, Kalisnik 2018, Reininghaus et al 2015, Skraba 2018, Topaz et al 2015, Zeppelzauer et al 2016).

NOTE: Folder missing--must fix! This subfolder contains persistence diagram data for 6 shape classes: A unit cube A circle of diameter one A sphere of diameter one Three clusters with centers randomly chosen in the unit cube Three clusters within three clusters A torus with a major diameter of one and a minor diameter of one half. These shape classes are described in Section 6.1 of the paper Persistence Images: A Stable Vector Representation of Persistent Homology , and are shown below. We produced 25 point clouds of 500 randomly sampled points from each shape class. We then added a level of Gaussian noise to each point, at a noise level neta=0.1 or neta=0.05. We then have already computed the persistent homology intervals in homological dimension i=0 and i=1. Should \"neta\" here be \"eta\" (Greek letter)? If so, we can then use MathJax on these equations. For example, the file ToyData_PD_n05_23_6_0.txt corresponds to noise level neta=0.05, the 23 rd point cloud randomly sampled from shape class 6., with persistent homology computed in dimension 0. Each row of this file has two entries: the birth and death time of a 0-dimensional persistent homology interval. By contrast, the file ToyData_PD_n1_21_3_1.txt corresponds to noise level neta=1, the 21 st point cloud randomly sampled from shape class 3., with persistent homology computed in dimension 1. Each row of this file has two entries: the birth and death time of a 1-dimensional persistent homology interval. Your task is to use machine learning to distinguish these six classes from each other. In a K-medoids clustering test, some accuracies and computation times are displayed for bottleneck distances, Wasserstein distances, persistence landscapes, and persistence images in Table 1 of Persistence Images: A Stable Vector Representation of Persistent Homology . Do you have ideas for beating these accuracies or computation times? In the above table, PD means the persistence diagram equipped with either the L^1 L^1 (1-Wasserstein), L^2 L^2 (2-Wasserstein), or sup (bottleneck) metrics. PL means the persistence landscape, equipped with either the L^1 L^1 , L^2 L^2 , or sup metric. PI means the persistence image, equipped with either the L^1 L^1 , L^2 L^2 , or sup metric. But you should develop your own techniques for turning barcodes into feature vectors, and see how they compare!
